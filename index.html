				<h1>The Fourth Phase: Travis Rice's new snowboard film is a gorgeous (and horrifying) masterpiece</h1>
				<p class="byline">By: Nate Scott | Oct 5, 2016</p>
				<p>The best scene in The Fourth Phase, the new 92-minute snowboarding film starring Travis Rice, does not feature a snowboard. The setting is Russia. Rice, along with fellow snowboarders Mark Landvik and Eric Jackson, has been holed up along with two helicopter pilots for over four weeks in a cabin, waiting for a break in the weather. They are about to lose their minds.</p>

				<h2>M Landvik</h2>
				<img class="responsive-img" src="ML.jpg">
				<blockquote>Hailing from Alaska, with big mountains and deep snow in his blood. He consistently brings powerful riding on-mountain and levity and fun off-mountain, making him Rice's go-to partner for adventure. He shares his off-hill craftsmanship including custom furniture and art with the world through N-Grained.</blockquote>

				<h2>Travis Rice</h2>
				<img class="responsive-img" src="TR.jpg">
				<blockquote>Born in Wyoming, as the son of a ski patroller, he has exhibited unmatched strength, skill and drive on the mountain from the time he could walk. He spends his time off-mountain developing the Supernatural contest series, working with Asymbol Gallery, and finding adventure on water.</blockquote>

			<div class="col s12 m4">
				<h2>Eric Jackson</h2>
				<img class="responsive-img" src="EJ.jpg">
				<blockquote>A Crowley Lake, California native, he has snowboarding engrained his blood. Coming up into the big mountains with his older brother John, he is full of adventure and wonderment. That sense of adventure took the Jackson "Brothers on the Run" from Alaska to Chile on the road trip of a lifetime.</blockquote>

				<p>The cabin is in Kamchatka, just a few hundred miles west of the Aleutian Islands tip of Alaska, one of the most inhospitable places on earth. Overlooking their cabin, which is built atop pylons planted deep in the Russian snow, a volcano spews black ash into the gray sky. They can’t snowboard – the mountains there are covered with a thin layer of ice, and the helicopter can’t get to the mountains of the nearby Kuril Islands, what with the high winds of this month-long, near unbelievable low-pressure system. They try surfing, dipping in the frigid Pacific waters nearby to catch a swell, but their limbs soon go numb (and Landvik can’t surf anyway).</p>
				<p>Left with nothing else to do, the three extreme athletes slowly descend into madness. The film cuts to Landvik, who has suddenly sprouted a twirling blonde mustache. He stares into the camera, his eyes wide, snow flecked across his face and covering his Russian wool hat. He screams.</p>

				<p>The music of Kishi Bashi, who wrote and performed an original score for the film, swells. Smith, Jackson and Landvik are all sprinting now, pushing a toboggan and leaping into the air like crazed animals through the deep drifts. These three men are not exactly known for their zen-like calm, and after a month in the Russian islands here in this desolate corner of the earth, they’ve snapped. This continues on, and on, beyond just a short interstitial between shred sessions; this is a major passage in the film. We cut to the cabin, and a title card tells us four weeks have passed. One month. The men whisper to the camera, cursing their luck, cursing God. Rumors fly, about each other, about when things will improve, about the weather.</p>
