				<h2>The Fourth Phase: Travis Rice's new snowboard film is a gorgeous (and horrifying) masterpiece</h2>
				<subtitle>By: Nate Scott | Oct 5, 2016</subtitle>
				<p>The best scene in The Fourth Phase, the new 92-minute snowboarding film starring Travis Rice, does not feature a snowboard. The setting is Russia. Rice, along with fellow snowboarders Mark Landvik and Eric Jackson, has been holed up along with two helicopter pilots for over four weeks in a cabin, waiting for a break in the weather. They are about to lose their minds.</p>

				<h4>Mark Landvik</h4>
				<img class="responsive-img" src="http://newschool-webfundamentals.github.io/projects/tara/ML.jpg">
				<blockquote>Hailing from Alaska, with big mountains and deep snow in his blood. He consistently brings powerful riding on-mountain and levity and fun off-mountain, making him Rice's go-to partner for adventure. He shares his off-hill craftsmanship including custom furniture and art with the world through N-Grained.</blockquote>

				<h4>Travis Rice</h4>
				<img class="responsive-img" src="http://newschool-webfundamentals.github.io/projects/tara/TR.jpg">
				<blockquote>Born in Wyoming, as the son of a ski patroller, he has exhibited unmatched strength, skill and drive on the mountain from the time he could walk. He spends his time off-mountain developing the Supernatural contest series, working with Asymbol Gallery, and finding adventure on water.</blockquote>

			<div class="col s12 m4">
				<h4>Eric Jackson</h4>
				<img class="responsive-img" src="http://newschool-webfundamentals.github.io/projects/tara/EJ.jpg">
				<blockquote>A Crowley Lake, California native, he has snowboarding engrained his blood. Coming up into the big mountains with his older brother John, he is full of adventure and wonderment. That sense of adventure took the Jackson "Brothers on the Run" from Alaska to Chile on the road trip of a lifetime.</blockquote>

				<p>The cabin is in Kamchatka, just a few hundred miles west of the Aleutian Islands tip of Alaska, one of the most inhospitable places on earth. Overlooking their cabin, which is built atop pylons planted deep in the Russian snow, a volcano spews black ash into the gray sky. They can’t snowboard – the mountains there are covered with a thin layer of ice, and the helicopter can’t get to the mountains of the nearby Kuril Islands, what with the high winds of this month-long, near unbelievable low-pressure system. They try surfing, dipping in the frigid Pacific waters nearby to catch a swell, but their limbs soon go numb (and Landvik can’t surf anyway).</p>
				<p>Left with nothing else to do, the three extreme athletes slowly descend into madness. The film cuts to Landvik, who has suddenly sprouted a twirling blonde mustache. He stares into the camera, his eyes wide, snow flecked across his face and covering his Russian wool hat. He screams.</p>

				<p>The music of Kishi Bashi, who wrote and performed an original score for the film, swells. Smith, Jackson and Landvik are all sprinting now, pushing a toboggan and leaping into the air like crazed animals through the deep drifts. These three men are not exactly known for their zen-like calm, and after a month in the Russian islands here in this desolate corner of the earth, they’ve snapped. This continues on, and on, beyond just a short interstitial between shred sessions; this is a major passage in the film. We cut to the cabin, and a title card tells us four weeks have passed. One month. The men whisper to the camera, cursing their luck, cursing God. Rumors fly, about each other, about when things will improve, about the weather.</p>

				<p>You are watching a snowboard film, an exercise that comes with expectations. Most people watch these things to see cool athletes perform sweet tricks with some jamming tunes on in the background. And yet, for near half an hour in a 90-minute film, no one snowboards. Which may lead you to ask: Is this even a snowboarding film? And if it isn’t, what, exactly, is it?</p>

				<p>The Fourth Phase premiered worldwide Sunday night via Red Bull TV, the company’s online streaming service, for free, available for anyone with an internet connection to watch around the world. It is now available on iTunes and Amazon and anywhere else you can buy high quality extreme content out on the internet. The film is created by and stars Rice, the 33-year-old snowboarder whose name is often prefixed with the world “legendary.” Rice is a pioneer in the world of big mountain snowboarding, the man who, perhaps more than anyone else alive, has pushed the sport higher, into ever more terrifying places. If Shaun White is the king of the halfpipe, Rice is the king of the untouched, 11,000-foot-high mountain ridge.</p>

				<p>(Not that Rice is a stranger to the competition world – he burst onto the scene in 2001 when he, an unknown 18-year-old punk from Jackson Hole, showed up at Snowboarder Magazine’s Superpark event uninvited and promptly started throwing down backside rodeos over a 100-foot gap, something no one else at the competition would have even dreamed of attempting. He’s since won a few competitions and an X Games gold in slopestyle, but for the most part, he’s moved on from judge’s scorecards, instead finding satisfaction in finding lines down the most terrifying mountains on earth.)</p>
